# Projects, git, github intro

## Further tasks to practice

Please find one or two colleagues for this practice.  
The primary goal is to exchange some files with a colleague through the GitHub repository.

You:

- In your GitHub account you need to have a new empty repository.
- In GitHub, in the repository: add the colleague(s) as collaborator(s).
- `git add/commit/push` a simple text file to the repository (for example `README.md` with any text).
- Check that the new file is visible in the GitHub web interface.

A colleague:

- Confirm that you see in GitHub the content of the repository shared with you.
- `git clone` the repository to your computer. Go to the repository working directory.
- Open the `README.md` file. Add some text to the file.
- Use `git add` and `git commit` to store the changed version of the file in your local repository.
- Use `git push` to send the newest state of your local repository to the shared GitHub repository.
- Check that in GitHub webpages you see the newest changes.

You:

- Check that in GitHub webpages you see the newest changes.
- `git pull` the repository to your computer.
- Modify, `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`...

Any of you:

- Repeat the process for a Python notebook file (note: always use *Clear all outputs* button before commiting a file to the repository).
